# Erick Reyes - Individual Project - Scent Dex
## Problem Statement
Fragrances as a hobby can be characterized as an exploration. There are many scent notes, characteristics, and descriptions to go through.<br/>
Many existing fragrance websites do help users find a scent, but it's cluttered with advertisements and other shopfront features. It also doesn't help that most of them look dated in terms of appearance and operations.<br>
Scent Dex aims to guide users towards their next fragrance by providing a minimalist interface free from distractions; enabling the user to add, lookup, update, and delete fragrances. Additionally, users can leave reviews, add a rating, and add scents to a personal wishlist to keep track of their interests.<br>
By making steady progress until the end of the semester, my hope is to provide a fresh experience for people looking to get into the world of fragrances.
