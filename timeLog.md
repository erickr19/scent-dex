# Scent Dex Journal
## Week 1
Not much was done in week 1.

## Week 2
### Update
I completed class week 2 activity 3 which had me create the initial project files on Wednesday morning.
### Key learning points
Some key learning points so far would be creating a brand-new Maven project within IntelliJ IDEA.

## Week 3
Week 3 is where I have started designing Scent Dex using Figma. Additionally, I wrote user stories using Trello.
This week was the first one that I've started feeling overwhelmed by how much needs to get for the project. It seems like a daunting task, however, I feel that good planning will guide me through this.

The Trello User Story Board is located in the design-files directory called "user-stories.png". The current design files are the other files besides the user-stories.

As far as designing, I do well when it comes to placing components and determining an appropriate layout for a website/webapp, but I struggle with colors. I generate palettes using coolors.co and I experiment with them on the design file. I personally feel that it's hard to apply colors to a web application since it really brands the project. For example, making a website with primarily red colors expresses action, love, or urgency.

As far as course material goes, I understand how I can apply Log4J and JUnit to my project. As I have not started any of the program files yet, it will be easier to implement them as I go.

## Week 4
Putting the finishing touches on user stories and design for the first checkpoint. Started to work on the Hibernate exercise for week 4. I think Hibernate will make it much easier to access a database from my web application. It's apparent to me that it will streamline the programming aspect of database connectivity and manipulation.

## Week 5
This is the first week of putting work into Scent-Dex. It involved adding the necessary package directories, adding the needed dependencies, and even adding the first entity to the project.
Since actual project work started at this week: I already feel behind schedule even though I am meeting my project plan.

## Week 6
I started working on the front-end portion of the project during this week. This involved working on index.jsp (the homepage), learn.jsp (a supplemental page), nav.jsp for navigation, head.jsp, and adding images to the web app.
I also added an empty Homepage controller for handling requests for the homepage. As for CSS, I added a link in head.jsp that links to the Bootstrap CSS framework. I also added a main css file to add my own custom styles to the project.

## Week 7
This week is where I started to improve the structure of my project page. Such as improving my project's "elevator pitch", accessibility to project design files, and keeping ideas in mind from Sydney St Clair's suggestions. On top of this, this where I planned my database and had to review how they worked.
I started writing down the design by putting tables on individual sticky notes. From that, I moved to a tool that allowed me to make a rough ERD. Finally, I was able to create the database and a proper ERD from DataGrip.

## Week 8
This week is a major catch-up week. I feel behind in my work but hopefully after this week is where I will catch up and maybe even be ahead of where I want to be. Ideally, I would like to have all the back-end functionality completed to focus more on the front-end. As far as for what I did get finished. I ended up finishing _all_ entities, adding a generic dao, and finishing _all_ DAO tests with most coverage.
I implemented Log4J2 properly. I was able to refresh my git repo to implement changes in my .gitignore file.
### Key learning points
Week 8 was one of the more challenging ones. Especially when coding entity relationships. There have been many bugs that ranged from the MySQL server being corrupted to constraint violations. I would say the ratio from code to debugging was 1:4. It was very easy to want to give up on a bug, and sometimes it did burn me out.
My biggest takeaway this week to be patient especially when debugging. Taking breaks when needed is important as well to avoid major burnout. In the future, I will know that implementing an ORM framework will probably need more time and effort.
