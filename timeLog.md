# Scent Dex Journal
## Week 1
Not much was done in week 1.
## Week 2
### Update
I completed class week 2 activity 3 which had me create the initial project files on Wednesday morning.
### Key learning points
Some key learning points so far would be creating a brand-new Maven project within IntelliJ IDEA.
## Week 3
Week 3 is where I have started designing Scent Dex using Figma. Additionally, I wrote user stories using Trello.
This week was the first one that I've started feeling overwhelmed by how much needs to get for the project. It seems like a daunting task, however, I feel that good planning will guide me through this.

The Trello User Story Board is located in the design-files directory called "user-stories.png". The current design files are the other files besides the user-stories.

As far as designing, I do well when it comes to placing components and determining an appropriate layout for a website/webapp, but I struggle with colors. I generate palettes using coolors.co and I experiment with them on the design file. I personally feel that it's hard to apply colors to a web application since it really brands the project. For example, making a website with primarily red colors expresses action, love, or urgency.

As far as course material goes, I understand how I can apply Log4J and JUnit to my project. As I have not started any of the program files yet, it will be easier to implement them as I go.
## Week 4
### As of 2/8
Putting the finishing touches on user stories and design for the first checkpoint. Started to work on the Hibernate exercise for week 4. I think Hibernate will make it much easier to access a database from my web application. It's apparent to me that it will streamline the programming aspect of database connectivity and manipulation.
